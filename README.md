# Heya ðŸ‘‹!

My name is Daniel and I'm a Software Engineer currently studying at Hogeschool Leiden in The Netherlands. Get to know me with this README!

## ðŸ’ª Current projects
I'm currently heavily working on a library called [Chainson](https://github.com/abcdan/chainson). It's a database without dependencies or SQL. It's basically a glorified persistent Map that's also really easy to work with.

Nex to that, I work on
- [file.coffee](https://file.coffee) from time to time;
- [cite.party](https://cite.party) for school + hobby;
- [EasyTickets](https://easytickets.xyz) once in a blue moon;
- A lot of one day projects.

For more projects, check out my website [lngzl.nl/projects](https://lngzl.nl/projects)

## ðŸŒ³ "Save" the climate!
I plant trees through <a href="https://ecologi.com/lngzl?r=6005cc57f70194001deaedfa">Ecoligi</a>* to compensate for the tonnes of co2 I produce as a human being (that actively uses the internet). I'm not going vegan or anything so I thought this would be a good _(and lazy)_ way to help the world become slightly better in terms of climate change. I'm far from a good example but ay, everything helps.
